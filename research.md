# Secure Multiparty Computation

Secure Multiparty Computation allows a groups of mutually distrustful data owners to collaboratively compute statistics 
on their private data, without revealing their underlying data to each other, or any outside party.  
MPC has been used to [execute a private auction without a trusted auctioneer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03549-4_20), [detect satellite collisions](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44618-9_9) without requiring operators to share 
orbital information, [calculate payroll statistics across multiple companies in Boston](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7839796), [securely computing Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4108),

# Blockchain

I am interested in the economics and mechanisms that are being developed and deployed in the blockchain space.

Voting mechanisms are being used in a variety of ways in the blockchain space
1. Determining the set of block producers in Proof-of-Stake chains like the [Cosmos hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/overview.html) and most chains built using the Cosmos SDK
1. Managing DeFi platforms, e.g. [Maker](https://vote.makerdao.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance), [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/) and many others
1. Managing pooled investments in different spaces like [music](https://www.beetsdao.com/), [art](https://pleasr.org/#) and [many others](https://decrypt.co/88894/11-most-interesting-daos-of-2021)
How should we structure the voting mechanisms to effectively tap into the wisdom of the crowd?

If you're interested in learning more about the technical underpinnings of blockchains, I've put together a set 
of [blockchain_resources].
