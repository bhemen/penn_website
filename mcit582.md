# MCIT 582 - Blockchains

I co-teach the blockchain course in Penn's [MCIT Online program](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) with [Mohammad Amiri](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~amiri/).
The course provides an in-depth introduction to the cryptography and consensus mechanisms that form the foundation of essentially all existing blockchain platforms.
In the weekly homework assignments, we'll use python to interact with the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Algorand blockchains.
The course assumes no prior knowledge of cryptography or distributed systems, but a basic familiarity with Python will is helpful.
