# Reading

If you haven't already, you should read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

If you're interested in analyzing on-chain data the [Ethereum Docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) are a good place to start to get a feeling for how data is actually stored on the (Ethereum) blockchain.
The [ERC-20 token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) for fungible tokens, and the [ERC-721 token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) 
for non-fungible tokens have become key parts of the blockchain ecosystem, and so it's important to get a good handle on how they function.

# Podcasts

The [Zero Knowledge podcast](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm) is by far the best podcast for learning about the technical underpinnings of the blockchain technology.  Although it focuses on applications related to Zero Knowledge, it covers a broad range of topics outside of Zero Knowledge as well. 
[Epicenter](https://epicenter.tv/) is also quite good.

Lane Rettig's interviews on [What Bitcoin Did](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com) provide a very clear explanation of what makes Bitcoin special (in contrast to the many newer, faster layer 1s) 
	* [The Failure of Ethereum Governance](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/the-failure-of-ethereum-governance)
	* [Why Proof of Stake is Flawed](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/why-proof-of-stake-is-flawed)
