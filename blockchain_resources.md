The blockchain space is so full of people looking to hype their investments that it can be difficult to find quality content amid the sea of trash.
Here are some resources that can help you get started in the space.

# Reading

* [Ethereum Docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/)

# Podcasts

* [Zero Knowledge Podcast](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/)
  * The Zero Knowledge podcast is by far the best podcast for learning about the technical underpinnings of the blockchain technology.  Although it focuses on applications related to Zero Knowledge, it covers a broad range of topics outside of Zero Knowledge as well. 
* [Epicenter](https://epicenter.tv/)
  * Epicenter has some excellent episodes, but the interviewers often let the interviewees over-hype their projects
* [Interchain FM](https://interchain.fm/)
  * The Interchain podcast focuses on the projects that interact with the [Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network/)
* [Solana Podcast](https://podcast.solana.com/)
  * The Solana podcast focuses on projects that interact with the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/), but also covers topics that are relevant to all aspects of the blockchain ecosystem.
* [Uncommon Core](https://uncommoncore.co/)
  * [Hasu](https://twitter.com/hasufl), the host of this podcast is a trader / investor, so many of the episodes focus on the investing rather than diving into the technical details of different projects and platforms.  There are several good episodes, however, like Hasu's [interview with an MEV Searcher](https://anchor.fm/uncommoncore/episodes/Interview-with-a-Searcher---with-MEV-Senpai-and-Hasu-e14n9nq), and Hasu's [interview with Eli-Ben Sasson](https://anchor.fm/uncommoncore/episodes/Hasu-gets-STARK-pilled---with-Eli-Ben-Sasson-StarkWare-e1bq6nt)
* Lane Rettig's interviews on [What Bitcoin Did](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com) provide the clearest explanation of what makes Bitcoin special (in contrast to the many newer, faster layer 1s) 
	* [The Failure of Ethereum Governance](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/the-failure-of-ethereum-governance)
	* [Why Proof of Stake is Flawed](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/why-proof-of-stake-is-flawed)
